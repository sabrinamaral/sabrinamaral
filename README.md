        <p>Hello there, Iâ€™m Sabrina.</p>
        <p> I have a passion for learning and expanding my knowledge.</p>
        <p> Completing bolth the <img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/T02NE0241/wagon-logo/8174979b99be030e.png" height='25rem' alt="Le Wagon Logo"> <a href='https://lewagon.com'> Le Wagon</a> Bootcamp and the <a href='https://devinhouse.tech/'>DevInHouse course at SENAC SC</a> was challenging, but also rewarding experience. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to learn new skills such as Ruby, Ruby on Rails, OOP, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, and JS. </p>
        <p> I also completed the highly prestigious <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/"> CS50 Introduction to Computer Science</a>, a <img src="https://github.com/sabrinamaral/sabrinamaral/assets/75286666/7068e45d-ae92-4078-8fad-4adb1079f98d" height='25rem' alt="harvard_logo"> Harvard University online course. This course is designed to teach the fundamental concepts of computer science and programming, covering a wide range of topics such as algorithms, data structures, abstraction, cryptography, artificial intelligence, and web development. It is a challenging course that exposes me to various programming languages and tools, including C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By completing this course, I gained a deep understanding of how to think computationally and creatively, and how to use computers to solve real-world problems. This course is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to take their computer science skills to the next level and become a proficient programmer. It provides me with a rock-solid foundation that will enable me to excel in my future endeavors in the computer science field.
        <p> Recently, I completed the <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python"> Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python <a/> at <img height='25rem' alt="mit_logo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc385f2f-9a42-4047-99e9-dc83747caf11" /> MITx Online. Over the past two months, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of core computer science concepts - including Big O Notation, Binary Search, and Recursion - through a thoughtful blend of theory and hands-on coding exercises. The course made complex topics feel accessible, and it's helped me further solidify my foundation in programming and problem-solving.</p>
        <p> All this learning helped me overcome a repetitive task I faced in my previous job. I developed a Rails application that reconciles transactions between two CSV files and includes an interactive cash flow. If youâ€™re interested in checking it out, itâ€™s available in the finance reconciliation repository.</p>
